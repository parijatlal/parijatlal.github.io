I’m an economist at Columbia University studying issues in economic development and inequality. So far, my research has focused on leveraging large-scale administrative data to answer questions in industrial development, labor, and public economics. You can find my CV [here](https://parijatlal.github.io/files/lal_parijat_cv.pdf/).

I was born in Germany, and had the privilege of living in India (my home country), Iran, Austria, Thailand, and Kenya before coming to the US for college. I’m a big fan of (old school) hip hop, (Arsenal and Germany) football, reading historical fiction, and exploring different cuisines. Feel free to reach out!
