<medium> I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar under Joseph Stiglitz at Columbia University with interests in studying economic development and inequality. So far, my research has focused on leveraging large-scale administrative data to answer questions in industrial development, labor, and public economics. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University in 2024 and hold a B.A. in Economics from Harvard University.

I was born in Germany, and had the privilege of living in India (my home country), Iran, Austria, Thailand, and Kenya before coming to the US for college. Iâ€™m a big fan of (old school) hip hop, (Arsenal and Germany) football, reading historical fiction, and exploring different cuisines. Feel free to reach out! </medium>
